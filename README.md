## Initializing the Project

I used Anaconda to set up the project environment.

```powershell
conda create -n <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
conda activate <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
# If you don't have conda, you can use pip to install the required packages.
# pip install -r requirements.txt
conda list --export > requirements.txt
# Exports the conda environment to a YAML file.
conda env export > environment.yml
```

You can install the requirements using:

```powershell
# From requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or from environment.yml (recommended for conda)
conda env create -f environment.yml -n <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
conda activate <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

> [!IMPORTANT] DEPENDENCIES
> Both files need to be updated whenever new packages are added to the project or existing ones are updated.

> [!IMPORTANT] CODE-WORKSPACE
> In the `code-workspace` file, set `"CONDA_ENV"` to the name of the conda environment you created. This will allow VS Code to automatically activate the correct environment when you open the workspace.

```powershell
conda list --export > requirements.txt & conda env export > environment.yml
```

An existing environment can be updated with:

```powershell
conda env update -f environment.yml -n <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
```

## Testing

To make pytest and other Pylance find imports in the folder `src` or any subfolder of it, you need to configure the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include them. This can be done in `tests/conftest.py`:

```python
SRC_PATH = PROJECT_ROOT / "src"

if str(SRC_PATH) not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, str(SRC_PATH))
```

The tests can then be run with:

```powershell
pytest
```
